@W: MT529 :"c:\users\ed rod\downloads\lattice semiconductor.application_library_3\irda_uart_rx\uart_source\uart_ir_rx_ice.v":71:0:71:5|Found inferred clock uart|clk_in which controls 22 sequential elements including rst_count[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
